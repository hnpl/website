I'm a first-year PhD student in Computer Science at UC Davis.
I'm working with Professor Jason Lowe-Power on vector scatter/gather architectures.
Quantum error correction codes are also part of my study.

I received my Bachelors degree from UC Davis, where I worked for 2 years as gem5 software engineer.

## Research
My research involves,

- gem5, a hardware simulator.
  - Maintaining resources for gem5 full-system simulations.
    - Providing automation for building X86, ARM, RISCV disk images containing workloads. 
  - RISC-V Vector Instructions implementation.
  - gem5/SST simulator integration.
    - Providing a gem5 interface for communication with external simulators.
    - Using SST for gem5 multiple-node simulations.

## Previous Works
I worked at Professor Ian Davidson's lab in my undergraduate study, during which I co-authored [a SIGKDD paper](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=g6KC_pUAAAAJ&citation_for_view=g6KC_pUAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C).

## Teaching
I'd like to present an academic topic to students from a practical perspective.
I strongly believe in engagement in a topic comes from understanding the nature of the problem, as well as the capability of using tools (e.g. software, abstraction) for solving problems.
