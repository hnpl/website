I'm a third-year PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at UC Davis.
I'm working with [Professor Jason Lowe-Power](https://arch.cs.ucdavis.edu/people/jason-lowe-power) on vector scatter/gather acceleration via hardware/software co-design.
I also work with [Professor Isaac Kim](https://hackmd.io/39K7_jYrS3K3k4Jbn66iHQ?view) on quantum architectures.

I received my Bachelor's degree from UC Davis, where I worked for 3+ years as a gem5 software engineer.

During my PhD, I interned for 9 months at AMD Research, where I modeled a new hardware component in gem5/QEMU and developed the software stack for the new hardware.

## Research

My research work involves,

- Studying the performance of irregular memory accesses of HPC/graph-analytics/database applications on vector architectures.
- Enabling long vector architectures by reorganizing the cache system and address translation process.
- Modifying various parts of a hardware/software stack (e.g., kernel driver, compiler, ISA) to support new hardware organizations.
- Enabling gem5 RISC-V full-system simulation with the newer RISC-V software stack.
- Enabling multiple-node full-system simulations via [gem5](https://www.gem5.org/)+[SST](https://sst-simulator.org/) integration.

## Previous Works

I worked at [Professor Ian Davidson](https://faculty.engineering.ucdavis.edu/davidson/)'s lab in my undergraduate study, during which I co-authored [a SIGKDD paper](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=g6KC_pUAAAAJ&citation_for_view=g6KC_pUAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C).

## Previous Projects

- Working on gem5's out-of-order RISC-V Vector instructions execution.
- Implementing support for ARM load-link/store-conditional instructions for [FlexCPU](https://github.com/darchr/gem5/tree/flexcpu), an out-of-order CPU model.
- Implementing RV64IM in Chisel; utilizing [spike/riscv-isa-sim](https://github.com/riscv-software-src/riscv-isa-sim) for verification.
- Designing a modular write-back multi-way cache system and memory interface in Chisel allowing having an arbitrary number of cache levels.
- Synthesizing the [DINOCPU](https://github.com/jlpteaching/dinocpu) designs using [OpenROAD](https://theopenroadproject.org/).

## Teaching

I believe that engagement comes from understanding the nature of the problem, and the capability of using tools (e.g. software, and abstractions) for solving problems.

- Bootcamp Instructor, gem5 Bootcamp, UC Davis (Summer 2022).
- Teaching Assistant, Computer Architectures (ECS 154B/ECS 201A), UC Davis (Winter 2022 & 2023).
- Teaching Assistant, Optimization (MAT 168), UC Davis (Spring 2019).
- Teaching Assistant, Abstract Mathematics (MAT 108), UC Davis (Winter 2019).

## Other Projects

I ocassionally solve problems at [https://projecteuler.net/](https://projecteuler.net/) and [https://rosalind.info/](https://rosalind.info/).
I like solving problems with geometric interpretations.
