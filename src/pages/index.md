I'm a first-year PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at UC Davis.
I'm working with [Professor Jason Lowe-Power](https://arch.cs.ucdavis.edu/people/jason-lowe-power) on vector scatter/gather architectures.
Quantum error correction codes are also part of my study.

I received my Bachelor's degree from UC Davis, where I worked for 2 years as a software engineer.

## Research

My research involves,

- Studying the implications of vector scatter/gather instructions on performance.
- Working on gem5's RISC-V Vector instructions implementation.
- Maintaining disk images and Linux kernels for gem5 full-system simulations.
- gem5 multiple-node full-system simulations using SST.

## Previous Works

I worked at [Professor Ian Davidson](https://faculty.engineering.ucdavis.edu/davidson/)'s lab in my undergraduate study, during which I co-authored [a SIGKDD paper](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=g6KC_pUAAAAJ&citation_for_view=g6KC_pUAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C) .

## Teaching

I'd like teaching from a practical perspective.
I strongly believe that engagement in a topic comes from understanding the nature of the problem, as well as the capability of using tools (e.g. software, and abstraction) for solving problems.
