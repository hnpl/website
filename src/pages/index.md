I'm a third-year PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at UC Davis.
I'm working with [Professor Jason Lowe-Power](https://arch.cs.ucdavis.edu/people/jason-lowe-power) on vector scatter/gather architectures.
I also work with [Professor Isaac Kim](https://hackmd.io/39K7_jYrS3K3k4Jbn66iHQ?view) on quantum architectures.

I received my Bachelor's degree from UC Davis, where I worked for 2 years as a gem5 software engineer.

I'm joining AMD as a research intern this summer/autumn.

## Research

My research involves,

- Studying the performance of irregular memory accesses on vector architectures.
- Studying restructuring data blocks on vector architectures.
- Working on gem5's out-of-order RISC-V Vector instructions execution.
- Providing disk images and Linux kernels for gem5 full-system simulations.
- Integrating SST and gem5 for multiple-node full-system simulations.

## Previous Works

I worked at [Professor Ian Davidson](https://faculty.engineering.ucdavis.edu/davidson/)'s lab in my undergraduate study, during which I co-authored [a SIGKDD paper](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=g6KC_pUAAAAJ&citation_for_view=g6KC_pUAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C).

## Other Projects

- Implementing support for ARM load-link/store-conditional instructions for FlexCPU, an out-of-order CPU model.
- Implementing RV64IM instructions in Chisel; verifying the correctness using Spike/riscv-isa-sim.
- Designing a modular write-back multi-way cache system / memory interface in Chisel, allowing having an arbitrary number of cache levels.
- Synthesizing the DINOCPU designs using OpenROAD.

## Teaching

I believe that engagement comes from understanding the nature of the problem, and the capability of using tools (e.g. software, and abstractions) for solving problems.

## Other Projects

I ocassionally solve problems at [https://projecteuler.net/](https://projecteuler.net/) and [https://rosalind.info/](https://rosalind.info/).
I like solving problems with geometric interpretations.
